                Destruction Junkett is a decentralized art collective that meets weekly
                to engage in critique, workshops and meditation. The format of this meeting is:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>the group will sit in silence and meditate for 10 minutes</li>
                    <li>a speaker will share on a topic of their choice for 30 minutes</li>
                    <li>there will be a secretarys break</li>
                    <li>the group will enagage in back and forth discussion for 45 minutes</li>
                    <li>the group will close the meeting with a brief moment of silence</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Topics can range dramatically as long as the speaker is open to criticism and discussion on their topic.
                Any hateful or bigoted rhetoric will result in a barring of the commenter. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The purpose of the meetings is to enrich
                the reality of the viewer through thurough scrutiny and meditation on new ideas. 
                Any are welcome to attend this meeting so long as they consider themselves open and receptive to new ideas. 
                An axiom of the group is that knowledge and beauty can be found through anything, and by engaging with this 
                we move closer to the universe as a whole. On quadrennial basis the group will show work in some capacity, 
                all funds raised for this will be by the group and for the group. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Destruction Junket has no ultimate authority,

                means of allowing participants to serve the community and eachother.
